# Portal 2: Community Edition instances
This repository contains all the new instances shipped with p2ce.

## Why?
Portal 2's instances are good, but not perfect. A lot of mappers edit Portal 2's instances or create their own ones to circumvent certain design decisions. 
We see P2CE as an opportunity to remake all the instances from scratch and make them more powerful, modular and easier to work with. 
When mapping for P2CE, it is **heavily** advised to use our instances instead of Portal 2's, as they're now deemed deprecated.

## Contribution
Everyone is welcome to open a pull request to suggest changes or add features. 
When changing an instance, make sure that its functions are backwards compatible to the previous version, so that old maps don't break.
Please provide a zoo / test map that showcases what the new instances are capable of.
